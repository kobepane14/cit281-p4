<p>Write and export multiple auxilary functions that extract data to be utilized in server code using modern Javascript. Utilize these functions in a REST API server with multiple get routes. Add post, put, and delete routes to the server code to update, add, and delete data. All testing is done using Postman. I got great practice using modern Javascript, and learned how to write post, put, and delete routes to handle different types of requests from the client.</p>
